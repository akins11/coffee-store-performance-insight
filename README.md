better or worse. However, Store 5 consistently shows slightly lower figures in both total revenue and number of
transactions, indicating an underperformance compared to the other two. Also, despite **Store 5** having fewer
transactions, its percentage of total revenue is relatively high, which means that **the average transaction value in Store 5
is higher** compared to Store 8 and 3.

#### Potential Business problem:
Store 5 seems to attract fewer customers or drive fewer transactions compared to Stores 8 and 3. This could be due to
various factors such as lower foot traffic, ineffective promotions, or customer satisfaction issues.

#### Recommendations
To improve overall sales, conduct customer satisfaction surveys or analyze feedback to identify potential issues, for
example, service speed, product variety, ambiance. Also review Store 5â€™s location, accessibility, and foot traffic to
determine if external factors affect customer flow.
The high average transaction value in store 5 can be leveraged by implementing **cross-sell or upsell** strategies to
maximize revenue from the existing customer base. Finally, maintain or enhance what is working well in Stores 8 and 3,
by possibly expanding their product range or offering exclusive promotions to keep these stores competitive and further
boost their performance.
